### Dataset: Classifying Mushrooms

Website: https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom
- Accuracy: 98.9660%

### Dataset: Car Evaluation

Website: https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/car+evaluation
- Accuracy: 94.9074%

### Dataset: Miles per Gallon

Website: https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg

- This has a mixture of continuous and discrete data
- The issue I had is shown in the notebook
    - mpg has too many classes, so I had to reduce them.
- Accuracy: 94.8980%
